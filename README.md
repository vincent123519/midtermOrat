# Use Cases
A text input must be provided to add new grocery item / update a grocery item into the basket
Once user submitted a new item, it should add it to the basket list and set the textfield text to empty. An alert message to confirm that the right item is added to the basket must be shown
If user entered an empty item and presses Submit or hit enter on the text input, an error alert message must be shown to let the user know that an input is required
Each item added to the list must have an edit and delete button
Clicking the edit button should automatically set the item text into the textfield so it's easier to confirm it's the right item to edit. The Submit button text should now have an Edit text
As soon as the user made some updates and clicks Edit, the basket item must be appropriately updated as well
Clicking the delete button should remove the item from the basket and an alert message confirming the right item was removed should be visible
A Clear Items button must be visible at the end of the list and clicking it should empty the basket
Make sure the basket items are saved via browser's local storage so closing the page and running it again should still have the items visible and not start from scratch (a quick refresh on the page should also confirm this behavior)
